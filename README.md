This is my first complex project in HTML and CSS, which I completed as part of an online Udemy course on advanced CSS and Sass (https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/?couponCode=JUST4U02223). Through this project, I not only learned advanced HTML and CSS techniques but also gained valuable insights into writing clean, maintainable code. In this project, I used SASS to manage global variables and media queries, which streamlined the styling process. I also learned various layout techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid, to create structured and flexible layouts. By using media queries, I ensured that the design is responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes. More over, I've done two more projects that fix grid layout and flexbox techniques better: Nexter and Trillo.
